# Startup Resource Center

Welcome to Sentry's **Startup Resource Center** ‚Äî a public hub of practical guides, tips, and documents that startups and early-stage teams can use to navigate building, scaling, and compliance. Startups love Sentry and we love startups back. We also love transparency and [Open Source](https://opensourcepledge.com/members/sentry/). The goal of this repo is to share what we've learned at Sentry and at the same time, learn from others who contribute their knowledge.

## üöÄ What You'll Find Here

- **Guides** on navigating operational, technical, and legal challenges
- **Internal docs** and frameworks we've developed for decision-making
- **Tips** and best practices for choosing tools, building teams, and staying nimble

The resource center launches with our first contribution:

> üìÑ [**Legal Tips for Assessing AI Tools**](legal-tips-for-assessing-ai-tools.md) ‚Äî a practical guide to evaluating risk, compliance, and avoiding legal pitfalls when selecting modern AI platforms.

We're just getting started. Expect more resources to roll out regularly.

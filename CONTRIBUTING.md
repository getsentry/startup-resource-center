# Contributing to Startup Resource Center

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Sentry's Startup Resource Center! We created this repo to share what we've learned building Sentry ‚Äî and we believe in learning from each other, too. If you have knowledge to share that could help early-stage teams, you're in the right place.

## ‚ú® What to Contribute

We're looking for resources that provide practical value to founders, engineers, PMs, and other startup operators. These can include:

- Guides or checklists (e.g., hiring early engineers, choosing AI vendors)
- Internal templates or frameworks (e.g., product planning docs, security reviews)
- Best practices or postmortems (e.g., scaling infrastructure, handling SOC 2)
- Updates or improvements to existing content

**Good contributions are:**
- Actionable
- Clear and concise
- Based on real-world experience (not AI slop)
- Respectful of confidentiality and legality
